Overview

	Sometimes an application may be decoding information from a
	stream on the fly which is too large to be stored in a single
	buffer (if even possible at all). In this case, it is helpful
	to have a callback mechanism which OpenAL can use to generate
	more data for processing of the buffer.

	void BufferDataWithCallback_LOKI(uint bid,
		 int (*callback)(uint sid, uint bid, void *data,
		           enum format, uint samples));

        The parameters for `callback' are as such:

          uint sid
	  --------
          The source id that this request is associated with. Since
	  many sources may share the same buffer, this sid allows the
	  application to keep track of offsets and other state
	  associated with each source instance.

	  uint bid
	  --------
	  The buffer id that the callback is associated with.

          short *data
	  -----------
          The memory area that the callback should populate

          enum format
	  -----------
          The format the the output data should be in.

          uint samples
	  ------------
          The number of *samples* required.
