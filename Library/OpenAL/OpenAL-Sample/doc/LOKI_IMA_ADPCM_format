Overview

        This extension provides format support for IMA ADPCM data.
        Use of this extension allows the association of IMA ADPCM
        in addition to PCM formats for buffer data.

Issues

        The caveats and restrictions that relate to all formats supported
        via the callback mechanism apply.  Namely, certain filters that
        rely on having all data present to operate (like the pitch operation)
        may result in NOP.  This format tag is invalid as an internalFormat
        hint to functions that accept them.

        The presence of a separate entry point is unneeded and serves no
        purpose as the extension tokens, passed to BufferData, suffice to
        completely use this extension.  Further revisions of this extension
        will remove this deprecated entry point.
