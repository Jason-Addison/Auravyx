Overview

        When a PCM buffer is provided to OpenAL, the application coder
        must supply information regarding the format. This extension
        infers the format / frequency information from the data
        itself, including information relating to compression, etc.
        This is useful for when the application is handed a chunk of
        data that it would like to use for a buffer, but cannot readily
        determine the type of data.

        Data is accepted in the form of entire sound files, in their
        native format. It does not accept raw PCM data. You can also
        inform OpenAL that it should use this memory itself instead of
        making a copy of the data for its own use.

        The alutBufferAndConvertData_LOKI() function returns `AL_TRUE'
        when the conversion and alBufferData() call was successful,
        `AL_FALSE' otherwise. If you specify that OpenAL should use
        the client memory, a call to alutBufferAndConvertData_LOKI()
        can return `AL_FALSE' in the additional case that it could not
        use the original data (ie, in-place conversion would be
        impossible without overflow).
