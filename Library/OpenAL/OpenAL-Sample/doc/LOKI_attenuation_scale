Overview

        Scales the units of the simulation used for distance attenuation.
        Without a call to this function, it is very likely that your
        application will not sound correct.

        The default scaling factor is such that a listener placed at the
        origin will hear sounds attenuated until that point that the
        sounds are `ALMAXDISTANCE' units away.  `ALMAXDISTANCE' is
        an arbitrary constant defined when including `AL/alkludge.h'.

        It is almost assured that the default scaling factor will be
        incorrect for most applications, thus the need for this call.
