Overview

        This extension provides a means for setting and getting the
        volume settings for various channels of the current context.
        The volume is represented as a normalized floating point value
        that is converted to a host representation.

Issues

        Some underlying hardware lacks the granularity of a full
        32-bit floating point value. Should we guarantee a
        granularity?

          RESOLUTION: No. It is impractical to attempt to force such
          when the hardware does not support it.


New Procedures and Functions

        float GetAudioChannel_LOKI(uint channel);
        void SetAudioChannel_LOKI(uint channel, float volume);

New Tokens

        Accepted by the <channel> parameter of GetAudioChannel_LOKI
        and SetAudioChannel_LOKI:

            ALC_CHAN_MAIN_LOKI                    0x500001
