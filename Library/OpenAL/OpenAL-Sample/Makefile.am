# Build, install and distribute the following subdirectories:
SUBDIRS = admin src common include

# We keep our local autoconf macros in a separate 'm4'subdirectory.
ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I admin/autotools/m4

# The following files should be in our source distribution in addition to the
# standard ones included by automake itself. A few remarks:
#
#  * As a temporary measure until the build system is fixed we mention a few
#    files which don't really belong here.
#
#  * We do not mention the doc and test subdirectories, they are really too much
#    out-of-date.
