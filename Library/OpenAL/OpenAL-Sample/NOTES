NOTES:
	GENERAL:
	A few functions are either missing or stubbed out.  If
	you need a function implemented in a hurry, please email me.
	99% of the stub/missing functions things need just a little
	glue.

	FILTERS:
	Filter functionality is uneven at the moment.  Except for
	alf_da, they suffer from deviations from their "specified"
	behaviour.  The frequency based filters deviate the most
	(if implemented at all).

	API:
	alkludge.h has been removed.  Remove references to it in your
	code.  Many things have been moved to extensions, try including
	alext.h.
