 *
 * These structures are used to group buffers in a growable array, so that
 * the relatively small allocations of AL_buffer objects can be combined into
 * a larger structure, in the hopes of reducing the effects of fragmentation.
 *
 * Each AL_buffer manipulated is actually a pointer to a bpool_node->data
 * object.  The bpool->node inuse flag marks whether the AL_buffer in a bpool_node
 * object is currently "alloced" (in the sense that the application/library is
 * using it) or "dealloced".
 *
 * The bpool_t object is used to collect those variables needed to manage the
 * bpool_node pool, in point of fact the size and the data itself.  Also, a
 * mapping of buffer ids (used internally and by the application) is present
 * to facilitate the easy conversion from buffer ids (which are in essence
 * arbitrary other than their requirement to be unique) and indexes into
 * the bpool_node pool.
