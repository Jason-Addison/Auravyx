This is a collection of programs related to OpenAL, the cross-platform 3D audio
API (for more information about OpenAL, see http://www.openal.org/). These
programs fall into the following three categories, each of which have a separate
subdirectory:

 * tests: These are pure OpenAL programs, which are in general only interesting
   for developers testing their OpenAL implementation or users having problems
   with their OpenAL setup.

 * examples: In this category one can find more or less simple programs intended
   as a reference for people who want to learn OpenAL. To avoid being distracted
   by tasks which are not interesting for that target group (e.g. loading sound
   files), these examples are based on ALUT. For more information about ALUT,
   see http://www.openal.org/openal_webstf/specs/alut.html.

 * demos: Programs showing off OpenAL features live here. These might be of
   interest even for somebody not intending to learn OpenAL itself.

If you find any bugs or want to contribute for yourself, please contact the
OpenAL developer mailing list at openal-devel@opensource.creative.com.
