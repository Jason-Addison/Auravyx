and ALUT, its accompanying utility library. Furthermore, there are
examples, test programs and specifications. Please visit the OpenAL home

The directories in detail:

 * alut: Contains the specification of ALUT and the freealut library, its
   free implementation.

 * contrib: Contains demos, examples and tests for OpenAL and ALUT. Not
   complete yet, some stuff is still in "demos".

 * demos: This will be moved into "contrib", see above.

   implementation (SI), based on former Loki efforts.  This implementation

   Windows code. Designed to replace the SI.
